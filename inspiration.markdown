Inspiration
--------------------------------------------

Nothing comes from /dev/null. Here are some sources of insipration for how I work and how I think.

### Music

Music is for the flow...
I could put so many inspiration sources here...so only my current obsessions...
Moby, Bonobo, The XX, Bran Van 3000

### Books

Books are for the deep current...
Kafka sur le rivage, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, The Book of Tea

### Programmers

These programmers are for the craft...
Why The Lucky Stiff, Steve Yegge, Ted Dzubia

### Blogs

Blogs are for pushing my thinking...
Seth Godin, Signal vs Noise
