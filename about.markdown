Who is behind side-experiment?
------------------------------
My name is Félix Trépanier. I'm a human, a father, a software engineer, a runner, a tea fanatic, a music lover and an idealist.

I program Java and experiment with Ruby.

What is side-experiment?
------------------------
I'm not sure yet! For now this is a creative space for me to expriment and create web applications using Ruby.

I want it to be a place where humanity, code and art somehow meet.

Why side-experiment?
--------------------
I need to create and want to learn Ruby.
